# Welcome to Open Source Travel Guide!

This travel guide is crowd sourced within an open source practice field day.
It's for fun, don't hesitate to fool around. Please add here your
recommendations on where you would like to guide your friends to visit. Or
what to avoid, if you absolutely feel so :D

This is an example of your story as separte file rather than appending to the common travelguide.md
